            <h3>Is it time to move onto FreeBSD ?</h3>

            <p><em>"This is getting out of hand,"</em> says <strong>Linus Torvalds.</strong></p>

<p>But what does this mean? It means that the development of the <strong>Linux kernel</strong> is being disrupted.</p>

<p>But by who? The right answer is <em>cucks</em> and <em>normies,</em> they are the ones who held Linux with their sausage-shaped fingers and took it as their goal to destroy everything like they did to <strong>Twitter, Reddit,</strong> or even <strong>YouTube</strong> (but to be honest, YouTube was a mess from the start).</p>

<p>The same thing for <em>Systemd;</em> it wants to remove the Linux kernel and implement its own called <strong>Linux XD</strong>, but for poor <strong>GNU,</strong> basically, everyone forgot about it. No one says <strong>GNU</strong> anymore; they just say <em>lincucks (Linux :p)</em>.</p>

<p>It became a sad tale for the people who used this <em>OS</em> before this plague.</p>

<p>But why <strong>FreeBSD</strong>? Well, <strong>BSD</strong> is a full <em>OS</em> unlike <strong>GNU</strong>, which are utilities, and <strong>Linux</strong>, which is a kernel and <em>system,</em> which is an init system and many other stuff.</p>

<p>This means that <strong>BSD</strong> is fully maintained by one big group that shares the same philosophy.</p>

<p>But why <strong>FreeBSD</strong> (again ;p)? Well, because it was made to be more of a <em>desktop OS.</em> Don’t get me wrong; it works better on servers, but it has support for desktops unlike other <strong>BSD</strong> based <em>OSs.</em></p>

<p>So am I sold to the <strong>BSD</strong> ecosystem? Not yet. I still like <strong>GNU</strong> and <strong>Linux;</strong> maybe not <em>system,</em> but I use them for now. And as always, if it ain't broken, don't fix it, just rice it ;D</p>
