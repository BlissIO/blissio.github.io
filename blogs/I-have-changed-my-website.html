	<p>Lately, I have learned a lot of <em>html</em> and <em>css</em>. I alwase thought my website looked ugly and it was so i needed something new, something that has more <strong>eye candy</strong> but <strong>minimal</strong> and as alwase no <em>js</em></p>
	<p>I hope this is better i showed it to people around me and everyone rated it around <strong>8/10</strong>, so i am pretty happy with that :D</p>
	<p>I don't think i will change this anytime soon.</p>
	<p>BTW, this layout was inspired from <a href="https://denshi.org/">denshi's website</a> huge thanks to him(It is no longer the same layout at his, he changed his wabsite too ;P</p>
