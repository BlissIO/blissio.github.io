	<h1>Is it time to move onto FreeBSD ?</h1>
<br><h3>date : 2022-02-10</h3></br>
    <p><em>This is getting out of hand</em> says linus torvalds</p>
    <p>But wwhat does this mean ? It means that the development of the linux kernel is being <strong>distrupted</strong></p>
    <p>But by who ? The right anwser is <em>cucks and normies</em>, they are the ones who held linux with their sausage shaped fingers</p>
    <p>and took it as their <strong>goal</strong> to distroy everything like they did to twitter or reddit or even youtube (but to be honest youtube was a mess from the start)</p>
    <p>same thing for <em>soystemd</em> it wants to remove the linux kernel and impliment its own called linuxd</p>
    <p>but for poor <strong>gnu</strong> basicly everyone forgot about it no one says <strong>GNU</strong> anymore they just say <em>lincucks</em> (linux :p)</p>
    <p>It became a sad tale for the people who used this os before this plague</p>
    <p>But why <strong>FreeBSD</strong> ? well bsd is a full os unlike gnu wich are utilities and linux wich is a kernel and systemd wich is an init system and many other stuff</p>
    <p>Which means that bsd is fully maintained but one big group who share the <em>same</em> philosophy</p>
    <p>but why <strong>FreeBSD</strong> (again ;p) ?</p>
    <p>Well because it was made to be more of a desktop os don’t get me wrong it works better on servers but it has support for desktop unlike other bsd based oss</p>
    <p>So am i <em>sold</em> to the bsd ecosystem ?</p>
    <p><strong>Not yet</strong> i still like gnu and linux maybe not <em>soystemd</em> but i use them for now and as alwase <em>if it aint broke dont fix it just rice it ;D</em></p>
