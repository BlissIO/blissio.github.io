	<h1>why would anyone make a website ?</h1>
	<br>
		<h3>date 2022-02-08</h3>
	</br>
	<p>Well a website is a place without censorship</p>
	<p>you can post anything you want well not illegal content of course but anything (Political, religious, hatfull....)</p>
	<p>you are the owner of this land and you are <em>free</em> to do whatever you want</p>
	<p>a place that represents yourself and your ideology </p>
	<p>lets say for example you hate someone like for example <strong>samir</strong>, oh here you are free to say that <strong>samir</strong> is and uneducated <em> cuck and a normie</em> he cant do anything about it ;D</p> 
	<p>That is the freedom that you are getting so dont let it go hold on to it, get a website <strong> NOW</strong> dont be a web pesent</p>
