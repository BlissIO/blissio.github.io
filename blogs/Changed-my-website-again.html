	<h1>I have changed my website</h1>
	<br><h3>date : 2022-02-11</h3></br>
	<p>I took some time out due to the final exams comming up. 20 days left for them. </p>
	<p>i am really scared about them, because i havent made that much of a progress on my lecons. There are around 30 lecons, that i have to memorise. I have memorised around 12, so 18 left.</p>
	<p>Anyway i changed a lot of the <em>css</em> and now it looks very nice, both on mobile devices and pc. But the thing about it is <strong>the bars</strong>, they are <em>rounded</em> but on chromium they are rectangular for some reason.</p>
	<p>Idc about chrome i use firefox. I have tried it for the last month, but there is a theming problem }( If you put it on dark mode the setting stay on light mode and the hamburger menus are all light so it looks very ugly:'( I am also changing the theming of dwm to a more <em>smooth</em> one and thats it. :D</p>
