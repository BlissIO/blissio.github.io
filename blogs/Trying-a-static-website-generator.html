	<h2>Trying a static website generator</h2>
	<br>
		<h3>date 2022-02-09</h3>
	</br>
	<p>This site is not maintained by a static website generator.</p>
	<p>I full made every single bit of <strong>html and css</strong> no <em>js</em> here.</p>
	<p>but today i tried <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">zola</a> a simple lighwieght static website generator</p>
	<p>but i didnt like its complexity because it make editing websites easy you dont have to go in every file and change them like i do it does that automaticly wich is nice</p>
	<p>but i hated the file been so far away (in seperate directories) and i dont think it will play nice with github pages because at the time of me writing this i don't have a <em>domain name</em> :'(</p>
	<p>I will give zola a chance an other day because it is soo frustraiting changing something simple in every file and most of the time i forget about something and it stays broken =(</p>
