            <h3>I have now downgraded my system (not really)</h3>

            <p><strong>It has been a long time</strong> since I posted any blogs or videos on my YouTube channel, and that is because I am nearing the end of 12th grade. But this didn’t stop me from using Linux and experimenting with a lot of different stuff since April 2022 I have switched operating systems more than ever. I went from <em>Arch</em> to <em>Artix</em> to <em>Void</em> to <em>Debian</em> and then back to <strong>Windows</strong>.</p>
            <p>I went back to <strong>Windows</strong> since I was not happy with what Linux offered me at the time, and all the bugs and hassles were getting in my way. I saw that I was no longer productive, and exams were getting closer and closer, so I decided to hop back on the ship of abuse that is <strong>Windows</strong>. Fast-forward to three days ago when I had <em>Artix</em> installed on my machine with <em>DWM</em> as my window manager, I decided I had enough of my machine getting in my way and decided to go back to what I knew best—<strong>Arch Linux</strong>!! You thought I would say <strong>Windows</strong>, huh?</p>
            <p>But <strong>Arch Linux</strong> was too bare bones for me, so I decided to use <strong>Arch Linux</strong>—it has a GUI installer with very good parameters. I installed the base installation with nothing on it and chose, for the first time, <em>Budgie</em> as my desktop environment. Let's just say I fell in love with it, and it has all I have wished for.</p>
            <p>These past few days have been a delight for me; I can finally use my computer properly and get my work done. I do not use any proprietary software other than my drivers, and I can finally say with confidence I am never going back to <strong>Windows</strong> if nothing bad happens in the future.</p>
