            <p><strong>The best technology to use will always be no technology, let me explain.</strong></p>
            <p>Most tech-savvy people have this feeling of hate towards tech, and I am too. And the more you know tech, the more you hate it. Tech, for me, just stands in my way. I know so much yet so little that it is so annoying seeing someone who can't even change the volume on his laptop running Windows.</p>
            <p>If you need to take a note, there is no better than a notepad—it is a piece of paper and a pencil, an eraser if you need, and you have <em>Microsoft Word</em> in your hand for only $0.00 a year. No internet connection needed, no electricity, no storage, no dumb limits on the name of the file.</p>
            <p>If you need to make a presentation, the best way is to write it on that note and memorize it, or don't even memorize it—just read it off the note. It is way superior to any BS like <em>MS PowerPoint</em> or <em>LibreOffice</em> or <em>Sway</em> or whatever you use.</p>
            <p><strong>To conclude, if you want privacy, anonymity, security, ease of use, and quality of life, don't use a machine, and especially don't use a machine that is connected to the internet or any form of communication like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, nothing at all.</strong></p>
