            <p><em>I</em> was wrong, about <strong>BSD.</strong></p>

            <p><em>Yesterday</em> I tried <strong>BSD</strong> on my main machine and it was a massive <em>failure</em> :( It was way different from any <em>gnu-based</em> distro or even any <em>distro</em> for that matter. It was <em>painful</em> and I am never doing it again on my main machine. It <em>broke</em> my <em>SSD,</em> so I spent the last night until 5 am <em>fixing</em> it, and I woke up at 9 am to <em>fix</em> it yet again.</p>
            
            <p>My <em>fix</em> was to <strong>install</strong> <strong>Windows</strong> and <em>format</em> everything to <strong>NTFS,</strong> then <em>remove</em> everything and <strong>install</strong> <strong>Pop!_OS</strong>! In the last 24h, I <strong>installed</strong> <strong>Arch</strong> <strong>Linux</strong> 5 <em>times;</em> it absolutely did not <em>work</em }( And also during the <em>installation</em> of <strong>Pop!_OS</strong>, it <em>failed</em> 4 <em>times.</em> Even though it <em>failed</em> the 4th <em>time,</em> I <em>rebooted</em> the <em>machine</em> expecting no <strong>OS.</strong></p>
            
            <p>But to my <em>surprise,</em> <strong>Pop!_OS</strong> <em>worked.</em> I don't know <em>how,</em> but it <em>did,</em> and here we are back to our <em>workflow.</em></p>
            
            <p>Even though I <em>use</em> <strong>DWM</strong> for the <em>longest</em> <em>time,</em> the <em>second</em> <em>distro</em> that I ever <em>used</em> is <strong>Pop!_OS,</strong> and it is <em>second</em> after <strong>Arch</strong> <strong>Linux</strong> in <em>terms</em> of how much <em>time</em> I <em>used</em> it for.</p>
            
            <p>This is not me <em>distro</em> hopping; this is me just <em>using</em> my <em>PC.</em> Even though I <em>tried</em> <em>FreeBSD,</em> it still does not <em>count</em> as it because <strong>BSD</strong> is not a <em>distro;</em> it is an <strong>OS</strong> ;p</p>
