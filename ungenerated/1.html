<p><em>Well,</em> a website is a place without censorship.</p>

<p>You can post anything you want, well not illegal content, of course, but anything (Political, religious, hateful....).</p>
            
<p>You are the owner of this land, and you are free to do whatever you want—</p>
            
<p><em>a place that represents yourself and your ideology.</em></p>
            
<p>Let's say, for example, you hate someone like, for example, <strong>Samir</strong>, oh here you are free to say that <strong>Samir</strong> is an uneducated cuck and a normie—he can't do anything about it ;D</p>
            
<p>That is the freedom that you are getting, so don't let it go—hold on to it, get a website <strong>NOW</strong>, don't be a web present.</p>
