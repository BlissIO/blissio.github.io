            <p><em>This site</em> is not maintained by a static website generator.</p>

            <p>I fully made every single bit of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>—no <strong>JS</strong> here.</p>
            
            <p>But today I tried <strong>Zola</strong>, a simple light static website generator, but I didn't like its complexity because it makes editing websites easy—you don't have to go into every file and change them like I do; it does that automatically, which is nice.</p>
            
            <p>But I hated the file been so far away (in separate directories), and I don't think it will play nice with <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> because at the time of my writing this I don't have a domain name :'(</p>
            
            <p>I will give <strong>Zola</strong> a chance another day because it is soo frustrating changing something simple in every file, and most of the time I forget about something, and it stays broken =("</p>
