            <p><strong>This last month</strong> I have not posted any video on my YouTube channel even tho my video of making a website blew up 21 views which is very surprising; I wasn't encouraged to post more videos but why?</p>
            <p><strong>Youtube</strong> is very restrictive and is no longer a YouTube; it is a celebrity/corporation tube, which is very far apart from a community-driven video hosting site, and I ain't making video for someone to use to harm other people.</p>
            <p>I will still post videos there, but I will be posting more on <strong>Odysee</strong> to favor it, and the only reason I am still putting my videos on <strong>YouTube</strong> is to attract more people to the world of <em>Free Software</em>, and that is it.</p>
