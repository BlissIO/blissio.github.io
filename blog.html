    <p>When I was jobless,
I started making and uploading videos on youtube,
I love making videos (no). Editing was always my hobby.
But after I got a real job, keeping up with channel got very hard for me.</p>

    <p>I love Mr Robot, it's deep, beautiful and sad.
We can anytime do an endless discussion on show's plot, characters and intention.
But here I just want to pick Elliot's character and talk about what I love
the most in him and what everyone can learn from him.</p>

    <p>Individualistic mindset originated from west, making it's way towards asian countries, ruining

    <p>Your choice doesn't matter - "You see ads". We all do :(
We got no other choice in this fast growing modern
<a href="https://sadgrl.online/blog/entries/attention-economy.html">attention economy</a>.
You have to be extremely autistic to ignore ads fully. Literally everything we consume get rigged 
with ads. You can't enjoy something without getting manupilated to buy something.</p>

Now since my country is filled with dumbass people like any other country (eg. America). These two groups keep fighting, talk shit about each other and argu <em>Mine religion is better cuz..., your religion is shit cuz...</em> all day.</p>

    <p>Yes, I run My personal git server -
<a href="https://github.com/shaolingit">https://github.com/shaolingit</a>.</p>
<p>It was so easy to do, I had no reason for not doing this.
I'll recommend every programmer to setup his own git server. As a programmer code we write is the most important thing for us. 
We should have full control over our repositories.</p>
