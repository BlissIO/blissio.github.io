                <p>I was wrong, about <strong>bsd</strong>.</p>
                <p>Yesterday i tried <strong>bsd</strong> on my main machine and it was a massive <em>failure</em> :(</p>
                <p>It was way diffrent from any <strong>gnu</strong> based distroh or even any distroh for that matter</p>
                <p>It was pain and i am never doing it again on my main <em>machine</em></p>
                <p>It broke my <em>ssd</em> i spent the last night until 5 am fixing it and i woke up at 9 am to fix it yet again</p>
                <p>my fix was to install windows and format everything to ntfs then remove everything and install <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop os!</a></p>
                <p>in the last 24h i installed <strong>archlinux</strong> 5 times it absolutly did not work }(</p>
                <p>And also during the instalation of Pop os! it failed 4 times even tho it failed the 4th time i rebooted the machine expecting no os</p>
                <p>But to my surprise Pop os! worked idk how but it did and here we are back to our workflow</p>
                <p>Even tho i use <strong>dwm</strong> for the longest time my second distroh that i ever used is Pop os! and it is scond after archlinux in term of how much time i used it for</p>
                <p>This is not me distroh hopping this is me just using my pc even tho i tried <em>Freebsd</em> it still does not count as it because bsd is not a distroh it is an os ;p</p>
