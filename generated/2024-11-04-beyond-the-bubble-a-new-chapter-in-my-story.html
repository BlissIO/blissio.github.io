                <h1>Beyond the Bubble: A New Chapter in My Story</h1>
                <h3>2023-12-13</h3>
                
            <p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hello, everyone.</strong> I am back, and I am proud to announce that I have changed a lot, and I would like to think for the better. I am not proud of my old blogs and what I have written in them, but I am not going to take them down. I'm going to keep them and keep them up, with all their mistakes and faults and whatever I did on them, just to have those to kind of look back on. Nobody is perfect.</p>
<p>I was blinded by some ideas and was very close-minded, so to speak. I had the idea of always looking for somebody that I can attach to, replicate their ideas, and take them into mind. I mean, that's how I started my first <strong>YouTube channel</strong> back in 2020. Not the one that I am linking to on this. I had another one. And I would generally just listen to people and what they said in multiple videos about a certain topic. Then I would turn on the camera and just speak and talk, but that would generally be influenced by them and not really thought out. But it worked out; a lot of people loved it, from my professors and stuff like that, but that wasn't really me. That was the ideas of other people regurgitated from my mouth.</p>
<p>And I have now realized a lot of stuff in my life and a lot of actions I have taken upon myself to make myself generally happier and more content. I am more responsible for the words and thoughts that come out of my head since now they're mine and I can't blame them. I will be angry when somebody opposes them. For example, I no longer use <strong>Linux</strong> or <strong>Ubuntu</strong> or any of the others. I am happy and content with <strong>Windows 10</strong>. I know it sounds like blasphemy for every Linux user. What about my freedom? What about spyware? What about a lot of stuff?</p>
<p>And let me tell you something. I'm done and I am tired, and I just want to make myself happy. I couldn't care less anymore about anything else that would make me happy and would improve my mental health. I have been in very dark places, and thankfully I am no longer there or still trying to get away. I still have a lot of problems, but I'm fixing them slowly but surely. And I have a much clearer view of the world and a much more open-minded approach to criticism and general debate, and I find myself much happier now. I've always been very repressed and will always be.</p>
<p>Being in this sort of bubble bottles up all my emotions and being afraid of any other opinion that would be outside. Generally, I just knock it off, even if it had the slightest scent of truthfulness. But that is not anymore. I realized my mistakes, and I realized how dumb a lot of stuff I did and said. But I am really happy and really proud right now that I am changing a lot of stuff, working on my own, and working on myself. Thank you, dear reader, for giving me some of your eyeball time. Thank you very much. See you in the next blog. <em>Bye-bye.</em></p>
