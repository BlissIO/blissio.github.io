                <h1>It Is Time To Wake Up</h1>
                <h3>2022-02-15</h3>
                
            <p><strong>It is time for you to wake up!</strong> Wake up from all the dull and tedious consumption you have been doing. Stop watching YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and other platforms, even decentralized ones. It does not make it any more better. If you are scared about your privacy and security, stop using the web; most of it is just that. Start shell scripting and automate everything.</p>
            <p>Even if you need to search something, search it from your terminal; no need for a browser most of the time. <em>"But what about my games and YouTube videos and my friends on Snapchat and Instagram; I need to keep up with them."</em> No friends are temporary; you can always make more on the fly if you need to. It is good to have one or even two like I do, but stop being the charitable guy. Don't give away your right to stand up for yourself.</p>
            <p>From now on, all videos with my face will be removed. Also, stop searching on search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo, and use <em>Wiby</em> and <em>Searx</em>. Don't be a normie; I hate those people. And for my email, don't worry. When I can get my hands on a bank account of mine, I'll host my own email. Proton is temporary. Patience is key to all of this; be strong and don't fear exploring new systems and new ways of living. You can be the best only if you are the best.</p>
